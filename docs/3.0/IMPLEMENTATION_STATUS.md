# HookKit 3.0 — Implementation Status

Live ledger for the HookKit 3.0 rewrite. Updated in every milestone commit.
States: **not started**, **in progress**, **blocked**, **complete**.

Scope, invariants, and milestone definitions live in the master spec (not
checked in verbatim — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the condensed version of what
actually governs implementation). This file tracks *status only*.

Two things this rewrite must not disturb without explicit sign-off, recorded
here because they are easy to forget mid-milestone:

- `../shadow` has an active, device-verified execution plan
  (`shadow/docs/STEALTH-HARDENING-PLAN.md`) unrelated to this rewrite. Do not
  touch that repo until a milestone explicitly calls for it (Milestone 14) and
  the user has signed off.
- Nothing in this repo may claim device-verified, fuzz-tested, or
  performance-gated status without an actual run. Every entry below states
  its verification level explicitly: **host-verified**, **device-verified**,
  or **not yet verified**.

## Milestone 0 — Baseline freeze

**State: complete.**

| Task | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Clean host build/test | complete (host-verified) | `make test` — 5 suites, exit 0 |
| Clean builds, all 4 packaging lanes | complete (host-verified, cross-build) | `./build.sh all` — rootful-legacy, rootful-modern, rootless, roothide all exit 0; `check-exports`/`check-compat` 64/64 PASS |
| Historical tags archived/referenced | complete | all 11 tags present locally: v1.0.1, v2.1.1, v2.2.0–v2.2.5, v2.3.0, v2.4.0, v2.5.0 |
| HookKit 2.5 performance baseline | not started | needs device access (launch CPU, RSS, VM region count, hook-install time — see spec §28.3) |
| Shadow performance baseline | not started | needs device access; also blocked on not touching `shadow/` yet |
| Reverse-dependency audit (v1 module API) — started | in progress | see `V1_MODULE_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT.md` (started, not concluded) |
| This ledger | complete | — |

Commit: `3e6bbdb` (native engine concurrency hardening — pre-existing
in-progress work reviewed and committed to reach a clean tree; not itself
HK3.0 architecture, but the baseline this ledger measures from).

Deviation from spec: performance baselines deferred — they require the
physical jailbroken test device, which has not been engaged yet this
initiative. Will request device time when a milestone actually needs it
rather than blocking Milestone 0 exit on it, since nothing downstream reads
the performance baseline until the release gates in §28.4.

## Milestone 1 — Architecture documents and schemas

**State: complete.**

| Task | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | complete | commit `59d291c` |
| `PUBLIC_C_ABI.md` (draft) | complete | commit `59d291c` |
| `Schemas/hookkit-artifact.schema.json` | complete | commit `53a209f` |
| `Schemas/hookkit-provider-evidence.schema.json` | complete | commit `53a209f` |
| `Schemas/shadow-hook-manifest.schema.json` | complete | commit `53a209f` |
| `Schemas/shadow-route-report.schema.json` | complete | commit `53a209f` |
| `ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` (draft) | complete | this commit |
| Legacy compatibility policy doc (`LEGACY_ABI.md`) | complete | this commit |
| `V1_MODULE_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT.md` | in progress (trending conclusion recorded; public-source search still open) | this commit |

Schema validation: all four `Schemas/*.json` files verified as both valid
JSON and structurally valid JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) via Python's
`jsonschema.validators.validator_for(...).check_schema()` — host-verified,
not just eyeballed.

Audit progress this iteration: checked every local sibling repo plus
`ios-repo`'s package metadata (real release notes/depictions, not just
source) for v1 module API consumers. Found Shadow announced a Modulous
migration twice (2023) for a "version 4" that was never tagged/released —
upstream stalled at v3.7.6 — and the current revival's own (superseded)
plan explicitly deleted Modulous, confirmed against current `shadow` master
(zero refs). Trending conclusion: v1 `HKSubstitutor` subset only, no full
module ABI. Not finalized — public-source search beyond local checkouts is
still open, tracked below.

Exit gate met: every non-negotiable concept from the spec has a named
representation across `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`PUBLIC_C_ABI.md`/`ENGINE_CONTRACT.md`/
`LEGACY_ABI.md`/the four schemas, and no native inline implementation work
has started (nothing under `Sources/Engines/` or `native/` touched this
milestone).

## Milestone 2 — Shadow manifest extraction
**State: not started.** Milestone 1 is complete, so the schema the
extractor writes against (`Schemas/shadow-hook-manifest.schema.json`)
exists. This milestone's tooling lives entirely in
`HookKit/Tools/shadow-manifest-extract/` and only *reads* `shadow/` (no
commits there, ever, for this milestone) — plain reads are already fine, per
the Milestone 0 audit work that already read `shadow/docs/*` and grepped its
tree without issue. The thing worth a heads-up before doing, not a thing
requiring sign-off to even attempt: running the real Logos-preprocessor /
Clang-AST crawl (spec §18.2) means invoking build tooling against
`shadow/`'s live source tree, which is a bigger and noisier action than a
grep — will build the extractor next against synthetic/local fixtures first,
and flag before the first real run against the live repo so any temp/build
output path can be pointed safely outside it.

## Milestone 3 — ABI freeze candidate
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 4 — Core runtime and fake engines
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 5 — Image catalog and resolvers
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 6 — Non-generated-code engines (ObjC, rebind, memory, Swift)
**State: not started.** Note: HookKit 2.x already has working, host-and-device-tested implementations of all four (`Backends/`, `native/hk_swift.c`) — this milestone is about conforming them to the new engine contract and ABI, not writing them from scratch.

## Milestone 7 — Native terminal inline
**State: not started.** Note: the atomicity work committed at `3e6bbdb`
(one-page-per-trampoline, atomic near-branch via inbound thunk) is a real
head start on this milestone's mechanism, done inside the 2.x engine. Formal
"zero relocation / zero trampoline / zero executable allocation for strict
requests" separation per spec §13.4 is not yet implemented.

## Milestone 8 — Native relocating inline
**State: not started.** Note: `native/hk_arm64.c` relocator already exists
and is host-tested (`make test-reloc`) — this milestone hardens/ports it, not
build from zero.

## Milestone 9 — Static continuation decision
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 10 — Provider adapters
**State: not started.** Note: 2.x already vendors and integrates ElleKit,
Substrate, Substitute, Dobby, Frida/gum, litehook, fishhook (`vendor/`,
`Backends/`) — this milestone is evidence + certification against the new
contract, not new integration work.

## Milestone 11 — Legacy facade
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 12 — Deferred lifecycle
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 13 — Packaging beta
**State: not started.**

## Milestone 14 — Shadow migration
**State: not started.** Requires explicit user sign-off before any commit in
`shadow/` — see boundary note at top of this file.

## Milestone 15 — Canonical release candidate
**State: not started.**

## Open deviations from the spec (running list)

1. Performance baselines (Milestone 0) deferred pending device access — see
   above.
2. `V1_MODULE_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT.md` conclusion is provisional — the
   public-source-search leg of spec §2.3's audit isn't done yet. Must close
   before Milestone 3's ABI freeze, not before Milestone 1's own exit gate
   (which only needs the concept named, which it now is).
